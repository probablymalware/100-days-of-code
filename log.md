# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed almost all of the HTML5 and CSS section.

**Thoughts**: I'm picking up CSS a bit quicker than I thought I would, it seems to click a bit better than it did the first time I tried it. Also, HTML5 and HTML4 don't seem to be completely night and day differences, I'm noticing the nuances in the changes.

### Day 2: Friday, April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML5/CSS, Bootstrap, and started jQuery.

**Thoughts**: Is Bootstrap pretty much an interactive replacement for CSS?

### Day 3: Saturday, April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed jQuery. Looked at requirements for first project.

**Thoughts**: Cannot brain today. Looking at the project made me forget everything I've worked on the last few days.


### Day 4: Tuesday, April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started first project.

**Thoughts**: Writing code from scratch is a lot more difficult than adding code to something already written.


### Day 5: Wednesday, April 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed first project, as much as I could do without diving into my books about the subject, anyway.

**Thoughts**: Okay, so apparently there's quite a bit of HTML4 that has deprecated over the switch to HTML5 that I need to learn.

### Day 6: Friday, April 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started creating a portfolio project. Laid the bootstrap framework.

**Thoughts**: Yay bootstrap!


### Day 7: Friday, April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting the portfolio examples set on the page. Learned some new bootstrap using thumbnail images.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap seems to be a lot more robust than I originally thought it would be. I originally saw it as just a way to make things responsive for mobile devices.
