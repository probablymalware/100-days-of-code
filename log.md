# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed almost all of the HTML5 and CSS section.

**Thoughts**: I'm picking up CSS a bit quicker than I thought I would, it seems to click a bit better than it did the first time I tried it. Also, HTML5 and HTML4 don't seem to be completely night and day differences, I'm noticing the nuances in the changes.
